# Tempered-AI

## Elevator Pitch

ChatGPT and Grammarly have become everyday companions for students. There's a growing risk that we're letting AI do too much thinking for us, leading to weaker critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.​

Recent studies show AI can boost writing quality and save time, but students who rely too heavily on AI understand less in the long term. That’s why we're building a mobile/web application that will encourage users to think first with features like reflective prompts, challenge modes, and usage tracking. ​

Our app will empower students and teachers to harness the benefits of AI while still building the independent skills that matter most for lifelong learning.
