# Tempered-AI

## Elevator Pitch

ChatGPT and Grammarly have become everyday companions for students. There's a growing risk that we're letting AI do too much thinking for us, leading to weaker critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.​

Recent studies show AI can boost writing quality and save time, but students who rely too heavily on AI understand less in the long term. That’s why we're building a mobile/web application that will encourage users to think first with features like reflective prompts, challenge modes, and usage tracking. ​

Our app will empower students and teachers to harness the benefits of AI while still building the independent skills that matter most for lifelong learning.

## Problem Description

As ChatGPT, Grammarly, and AI search engines become more popular, many users, especially students, have begun to rely on them too much. Instead of using them for support, users are asking these AI tools to do their thinking for them. While that may seem helpful in the moment, it could cause long-term issues in developing critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. 

## Customer and End User

EduSense will be most effective in the hands of educators and students as the end user. Instructors will know best how to implement our platform and maximize student benefit. We will focus predominantly on school administrators as our customer base. They are typically the ones who determine what tools are available to educators and students and have the knowledge needed to determine if a given tool is useful in their particular case.

## Solution Statement

Our goal is to build EduSense, a mobile app and web application that helps students and educators use AI tools more intentionally. Instead of giving direct answers, the app will encourage users to use their own thought process first with the help of guided questions, reflective prompts, and challenge modes that limit or delay AI input. The end goal is to help students better understand the material.​
The student's usage history will also be accessible to educators. This will allow them to identify problem areas in student comprehension and improve their lesson plans. Including integration with Canvas so that it can recognize the context of student questions.
