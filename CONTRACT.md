## Expectations:

- Each member will attend any meetings called during the above-listed available times with prior notice of at least 48 hours.
- Should a member be unable to attend a meeting, that person will notify all team members within 24 hours. They will also send any questions/comments regarding the meeting topic in advance of the meeting and their comments on notes/recordings from the meeting within 24 hours after. (If you can’t make it, we still want your input and participation.)
- All team members will use the team discord server for communications.
- Each member will do their share of the group’s work as agreed upon during work distribution and assignment.
- Team members will respond to email/posts within 24 hrs on weekdays, 48 hrs on weekends.
- Team members will be professional and respectful of one another in all communications.
- No team member will allow more than a week to lapse without making some substantive & visible contribution to the project.
- Work that only exists on a person’s own PC or in a person’s own directories does not qualify as visible. We will use a single organization/repository in Github to store all associated documentation, code files, and related project information for submission.
- Each member will submit their first submission 72 hours prior to its due date. Reviews and feedback must be submitted to the requester within 24 hours to give them as much time to make changes.
